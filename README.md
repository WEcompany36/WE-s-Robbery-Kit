# WE's Robbery Kit
With WE’s Robbery Kit, you can easily create a Jailbreak game with ease. In this version, you can change the currencies name without having to change the names in all of the scripts! Everything now works together! v1.1.0 also includes a new feature called AutoSetup! You won’t need to do anything but add the model to the Workspace, and you are done!

This kit is open sourced for everyone to use, but please do not claim your work as your own. 
It is optional to give me credit. (WEcompany on Roblox)

the kit also has a standalone .rbxm file, which you can convert to a .rbxl file or add directly to your game. It also includes some of the kits included. 
**The standalone is also the only way to add autoSetup, which is meant for new developers who would need help setting up the kit. **
